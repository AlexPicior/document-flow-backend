DocumentFlow is a web platform designed to automate and manage request documents and forms within companies, aiming to streamline internal processes and reduce processing times. It offers an intuitive, no-code environment with configurable workflows and customizable forms.

## Main Features

### Workflow Modeler
The Workflow Modeler allows administrators to visually create and manage workflows using a drag-and-drop interface. They can define who can start a workflow, add predefined components (like approvals or conditional branches) to the diagram, and link them based on execution logic. Each step can be customized with properties and reference names for dynamic behavior.

### Customer Support Request:

 1. The client submits the "Support Request" form, describing the issue and setting the priority level.
 2. A notification is sent to the "Level 1 Support" role to signal the new request.
 3. The priority is checked:
    - If "High", proceed to step 4.
    - If not, proceed directly to step 5.
 4. The "Support Team Leader" must approve the request:
    - If approved, continue to step 5.
    - If rejected, a notification is sent to the client informing them the request was not accepted.
 5. The "Level 1 Support" team is asked to complete the "Support Request Resolution" form once the issue is resolved.
 6. After the resolution confirmation form is submitted, it is archived along with the initial request.
 7. An email is sent to key company stakeholders to announce the resolution of a new support request.
 8. A confirmation notification is sent to the client indicating the request has been resolved.
